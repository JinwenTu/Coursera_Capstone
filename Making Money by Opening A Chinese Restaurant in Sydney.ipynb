    "## Introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "__Sydney__ is the state capital of New South Wales and the most populous city in Australia and Oceania. Sydney is made up of 658 suburbs, 40 local government areas and 15 contiguous regions. As of June 2017, Sydney's estimated metropolitan population was 5,230,330 and is home to approximately 65% of the state's population. \n",
    "\n",
    "Despite being one of the most expensive cities in the world, the 2018 Mercer Quality of Living Survey ranks Sydney tenth in the world in terms of quality of living, making it one of the most livable cities. In addition, Sydney is one of the most attractive cities for Chinese people as tourists and residents. In 2015-16 Mainland China (not including Hong Kong or Macau) was the second largest source of immigrants to Australia behind India. At the 2016 census, Sydney was home to 44% of the Mainland China-born population of Australia, while Melbourne was home to 31%. At the 2016 census, 487,976 (or 10.8%) of the inhabitants of Sydney who nominated their ancestry nominated Chinese ancestry solely or along with another ancestry. \n",

    "Based on the large population of Chinese in Sydney, Chinese restaurants are very profitable and thus a wise choice for investment.\n",

The guidance will include how to choose the location of the restaurant, what category of Chinese food is most popular, what features of a Chinese restaurants are most important to attract customer, etc. \n",
